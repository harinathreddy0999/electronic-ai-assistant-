# Project Planning: Electronics Virtual Technician

## 1. High-Level Vision

Create a virtual assistant that uses real-time voice and video interaction to help users troubleshoot consumer electronics (laptops, phones, chargers, peripherals, etc.). If troubleshooting fails, the assistant will leverage geolocation to find nearby repair shops or retailers.

## 2. Architecture Overview

A modular, likely cloud-based architecture consisting of:

*   **Frontend (Client):** Web or mobile application providing the user interface, video streaming, voice input/output.
*   **Voice Processing Module:** Handles Speech-to-Text (STT), Natural Language Processing (NLP) for intent/entity extraction, and Text-to-Speech (TTS).
*   **Video Processing & Analysis Module:** Ingests real-time video, performs pre-processing, and utilizes Computer Vision models for device identification, component recognition, and state/damage detection.
*   **AI Core (Backend Logic):**
    *   **Device Knowledge Base:** Stores information about various electronic devices, common issues, troubleshooting steps, error codes, visual cues.
    *   **Diagnostic Engine:** Uses information from NLP, CV, and the knowledge base to determine potential problems and suggest solutions.
    *   Orchestrates the interaction flow.
*   **Geolocation & Mapping Service Interface:** Obtains user location and queries external mapping/places APIs (e.g., Google Maps/Places) to find relevant local businesses.
*   **Backend Infrastructure:** Servers, databases (user data, knowledge base, logs), APIs connecting the modules.

## 3. Constraints & Considerations

*   **Real-time Performance:** Voice and video processing need to be low-latency for a good user experience.
*   **Accuracy:** Device identification, NLP understanding, and diagnostic suggestions must be reliable.
*   **Scalability:** Architecture should handle potential growth in users and knowledge base size.
*   **Data Privacy:** User location, video feeds, and conversation logs must be handled securely and comply with privacy regulations.
*   **Knowledge Base Scope:** The range of supported devices and issues will significantly impact complexity.
*   **Computer Vision Model Training:** Requires extensive and diverse datasets for robust electronics recognition.
*   **API Costs:** Usage of cloud services (STT, TTS, Vision, Maps) will incur costs.

## 4. Tech Stack (Initial Considerations - Subject to Change)

*   **Frontend:** React / React Native / Vue / Flutter / Swift / Kotlin
*   **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django/FastAPI)
*   **Voice Processing:** Cloud Services (Google Cloud AI, AWS AI), Libraries (e.g., Vosk, Coqui TTS, spaCy, Rasa)
*   **Video Streaming:** WebRTC
*   **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Cloud Services (Google Cloud Vision AI, AWS Rekognition)
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB
*   **Mapping/Places API:** Google Maps Platform / Mapbox
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Platform (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## 5. Tools

*   **Version Control:** Git
*   **IDE:** VS Code / Cursor
*   **Project Management:** `TASK.md`
*   **Testing:** Pytest (Backend), Jest/Vitest (Frontend), etc.

## 6. Development Process Notes

*   Follow the process rules outlined in the initial prompt (markdown files, small files, frequent commits/conversations, testing).
*   Reference this file (`PLANNING.md`) at the start of new development sessions.
*   Update `TASK.md` frequently.
